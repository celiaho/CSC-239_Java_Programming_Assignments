Account
- 	type: char 	valid entries 's' for savings, 'c' for checking 'L' for loan
- 	balance:double 	
- 	interestRate: double 	
- 	accountID: int 	start at 1000, increment by 1
- 	ownerFirstName: String 	
- 	ownerLastName: String 	
- 	lastUpdateDate: Date 	date of last update - used for calculating interest initially set 
to account open date.
+ 	Account(type: char, balance: double, interestRate: double, ownerFirstName: String, ownerLastName:String) 	
+ 	setters and getters 	
+ 	updateInterest() 	
+ 	makeDeposit(amount: double) 	also updates interest
+ 	makeWithdrawal(amount: double) : bool 	also update interest - returns false if unable to withdraw amt
+ 	toString(): String 	
- 	other private methods as may be required 	

1. Create Account class.

2. Create TestAccount class. instantiate an array of Accounts - the first 3 should be for owner Fred Flint, who has a checkng account with $100., and no interest, a savings account with $500 an interest rat of 0.5%, and a loan of $5000 at an interest rate of 8.25% for 5 years that Fred pays off monthly at 101.98 from his checking account. Create a loop that randomly creates a deposit or withdrawal and randomly creates a deposit or withdrawal amount between $0.99 and $99.99. There is one deposit or withdrawal per day. Do not forget to pay the loan from the checking account. Run your loop for 3 months, printing each deposit and withdrawal. On the first of each month, recalculate the balance of the savings account.  Don't forget to recalculate how much is owed on the loan each month. the loan and the savings account are both calculated using simple interest not compound interest

3. Don't forget to document your code.

4. submit your entire project as a zipped folder.
